With this screen, we can list our teams information. The user can add or remove any team. When the user creates a team, the program needs a team name, manager name and team line-up. Line-up values are set as “4-4-2” at the start but the user can change it.
Program shows created team’s informations on screen. Each column corresponds as below:

•	Team No
•	Team’s Short Name
•	Team’s Name
•	Team’s Manager’s Name

When the team’s creation is done, the program creates all the players with the given line-up informations. 
Example for “4-4-2” line-up:

•	1 Goalkeeper
•	4 Defender
•	4 Midfielder
•	2 Forward

Each player has a random name, no, age and power.
